# Collatz-Conjecture-Through-Parallel-Programming-
Computes the Collatz Conjecture in a parallel. It takes the String arguments  and checks for validation. If the validation holds true, it then computes the Collatz Conjecture  number and displays it. It does this in K parallel threads, where K is provided as input.
